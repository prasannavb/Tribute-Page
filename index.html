            <p id="About-info">Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer, rated as one of the best batsmen across all the cricket formats. Considered as a fierce competitor, he occasionally performs as a right-arm medium pace bowler. He is known for his dependable and powerful batting style and has single-handedly won several matches for India. Virat became fascinated with cricket quite early on in his life and took to the bat when he was just three. His parents recognized his potential and had him enrolled at the West Delhi Cricket Academy when he was nine years old. He developed into a very talented player over the ensuing years and represented his city Delhi at various age-group levels and domestic cricket. His first major success came in 2008 when he captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup. Soon he was selected to play for the Indian team and established himself as a valuable number 3 batsman. After having gained a reputation as an “ODI specialist”, he proved his mettle in test cricket and T20 cricket as well. Currently, he is the captain of the Indian team in all the 3 formats of the game.</p>
